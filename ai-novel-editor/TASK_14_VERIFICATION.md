## Code Quality

- ✓ All functions have proper docstrings with requirement references

4. Clicking the Truth viewer buttons in the sidebar
5. Testing search, filtering, and navigation features

## Conclusion

Task 14 is **COMPLETE**. All subtasks have been implemented with full functionality as specified in the requirements. The truth viewers provide comprehensive, user-friendly interfaces for exploring and searching the story's Truth knowledge base.
