## Tips for Best Results

### World-Building Phase
- **Be specific**: More detail = better AI understanding
- **Answer naturally**: Write as if explaining to a friend
- **Don't worry about perfection**: You can always add more later
- **Jump around**: Answer questions in whatever order makes sense

### Writing Phase
- **Save frequently**: Click "Save Chapter" often
- **Use AI sparingly**: Let it assist, not write for you
- **Review AI suggestions**: Always review before accepting
- **Build incrementally**: Write in small chunks, then expand

### Truth Management
- **Review regularly**: Check character sheets and timeline
- **Stay consistent**: The AI will help, but you're in control
- **Update as needed**: Truth can evolve as your story develops

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl/Cmd + S**: Save chapter (when in text area)
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Enter**: Submit forms
