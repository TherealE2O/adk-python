# Task 16: Error Handling and User Feedback Enhancements

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive error handling and user feedback improvements implemented for the AI Novel Editor application.

## 16.1 Comprehensive API Error Handling

### LLM Service Enhancements (`src/services/llm_service.py`)

#### Improved Retry Logic
- **Enhanced exponential backoff**: Increased wait times for better rate limit handling
  - Rate limits: 2s, 4s, 8s (previously 1s, 2s, 4s)
  - Timeouts: 1.5s, 3s, 6s (previously 1s each)
  - Service unavailable: 3s, 6s, 12s (new)

- **Added ServiceUnavailable handling**: Now catches and retries when the AI service is temporarily down

- **JSON parsing error handling**: Added retry logic for malformed JSON responses in structured generation

- **Success logging**: Logs successful retries to help track API reliability

- **Optimized sleep behavior**: No longer sleeps on the final retry attempt

#### Enhanced Error Messages
- Updated `get_error_message()` to provide more detailed, actionable feedback:
  - Rate limit errors now mention automatic retries
  - Timeout errors suggest reducing prompt complexity
  - Added specific message for service unavailability
  - All messages are user-friendly and solution-oriented

### UI Error Handling (`app.py`)

#### World-Building Page
- **Initial question tree**: Wrapped in try-catch with detailed error messages and retry button
- **Answer submission**: Added error handling with user-friendly messages and retry option
- **Progress indicators**: Added progress bars showing operation stages

#### Editor Page
- **AI editing operations**: All four operations (Improve, Expand, Rephrase, Suggest Next) now have:
  - Try-catch error handling
  - User-friendly error messages using `get_error_message()`
  - Retry buttons for failed operations
  - Success toast notifications
  - Spinner text indicating operation may take time

## 16.2 Enhanced Storage Error Handling

### Storage Service Enhancements (`src/services/storage.py`)

#### Automatic Backup System
- **Pre-save backup**: Creates `project.backup.json` before every save operation
- **Atomic writes**: Uses temporary file + move to prevent corruption
- **Validation**: Verifies JSON is valid before replacing original file
- **Auto-restore**: Automatically restores from backup if save fails

#### Recovery from Corruption
- **Backup recovery**: Automatically attempts to load from backup if main file is corrupted
- **Detailed error messages**: Provides information about both original and backup errors
- **Graceful degradation**: Continues operation even if backup creation fails (with warning)

### Project Manager Enhancements (`src/services/project_manager.py`)

#### Pre-Save Validation
- **Title validation**: Ensures project and chapter titles are not empty
- **Chapter number validation**: Verifies chapter numbers are positive
- **ID uniqueness**: Checks for duplicate IDs in characters, plot events, and settings
- **Data integrity**: Validates Truth knowledge base structure before saving

#### Error Categorization
- Separates validation errors from storage errors
- Provides specific error messages for each validation failure
- Maintains data consistency even when saves fail

### UI Storage Error Handling (`app.py`)

#### Project Operations
- **Open project**: Wrapped in try-catch with error display
- **Delete project**: 
  - Added confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Success toast notification
- **Save chapter**: Error handling with helpful recovery suggestions

## 16.3 Progress Indicators and User Feedback

### Progress Bars
Added visual progress indicators for long-running operations:

#### World-Building Operations
- **Initial question tree**: 4-stage progress (0% → 20% → 60% → 90% → 100%)
  - Initializing → Analyzing → Generating questions → Saving → Complete
- **Answer submission**: 3-stage progress (0% → 30% → 80% → 100%)
  - Processing → Extracting entities → Saving → Complete

### Toast Notifications
Implemented `st.toast()` for non-intrusive success feedback:
- ✅ Chapter saved successfully
- ✅ Text improved/expanded/rephrased successfully
- ✅ Suggestion generated successfully
- ✅ Answer recorded with question count
- ✅ Project deleted successfully
- ✅ Applied AI suggestion
- ℹ️ Suggestion discarded

### Confirmation Dialogs
Added confirmation for destructive actions:
- **Delete project**: Two-step confirmation (Delete button → Yes/No choice)
- Prevents accidental data loss
- Shows project title in confirmation message

### Auto-Save System
Implemented auto-save functionality with visual feedback:

#### Features
- **Auto-save toggle**: Checkbox in editor to enable/disable
- **Last save indicator**: Shows time since last save in sidebar
  - "Auto-saved just now" (< 5 seconds)
  - "Last saved Xs ago" (< 1 minute)
  - "Last saved Xm ago" (≥ 1 minute)
- **Automatic timestamp**: Updates on every save operation
- **Session persistence**: Tracks save state across operations

#### Save Operations
- Manual save button with auto-save toggle
- Automatic timestamp update on:
  - Manual chapter saves
  - AI suggestion applications
  - Answer submissions
  - Question tree initialization

### Enhanced Spinner Messages
Updated all spinner messages to set user expectations:
- "Improving text... (this may take a moment)"
- "Analyzing your story and generating questions... (this may take a moment)"
- "Processing your answer and generating follow-up questions... (this may take a moment)"

## Benefits

### For Users
1. **Transparency**: Clear feedback on what's happening and why operations fail
2. **Reliability**: Automatic retries and backups prevent data loss
3. **Confidence**: Progress indicators and confirmations reduce anxiety
4. **Recovery**: Easy retry options and backup recovery minimize frustration

### For Developers
1. **Debugging**: Enhanced logging helps track down issues
2. **Monitoring**: Success/failure metrics available in logs
3. **Maintenance**: Validation catches data integrity issues early
4. **Extensibility**: Error handling patterns can be reused

## Testing Recommendations

1. **API Error Scenarios**:
   - Test with invalid API key
   - Simulate rate limiting
   - Test with network interruptions
   - Verify retry behavior

2. **Storage Error Scenarios**:
   - Test with corrupted project files
   - Verify backup creation and restoration
   - Test validation with invalid data
   - Simulate disk full conditions

3. **UI Feedback**:
   - Verify all toast notifications appear
   - Test progress bars complete correctly
   - Confirm confirmation dialogs work
   - Validate auto-save indicator updates

## Future Enhancements

1. **Offline Mode**: Queue operations when network is unavailable
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent edits in multi-user scenarios
3. **Undo/Redo**: Implement operation history for easy recovery
4. **Export Logs**: Allow users to export error logs for support
5. **Health Dashboard**: Show API quota usage and system health
