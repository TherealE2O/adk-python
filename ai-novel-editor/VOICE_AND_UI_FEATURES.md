# Voice AI and Enhanced UI Features

## Overview

The AI Novel Editor now includes **full voice AI integration** and **enhanced visual navigation** for the interactive Q&A system, matching all project requirements.

## ✅ New Features Implemented

### 1. Voice AI Integration (Module 1.2)

#### Speech Recognition (Voice Input)
- **Real-time speech-to-text** for answering questions
- Uses Google Speech Recognition API (free)
- Supports timeout and phrase limits
- Automatic ambient noise adjustment
- Fallback to text input if speech fails

#### Text-to-Speech (Voice Output)
- **AI speaks questions** to guide the user
- Uses pyttsx3 for local TTS (no API required)
- Optional Google Cloud TTS for higher quality
- Configurable voice properties (speed, volume)
- Confirmation messages spoken after actions

#### How to Use Voice AI
1. Enable voice AI with the "🎤 Enable Voice AI" checkbox
2. Click "🔊 Hear Question" to have the AI speak the question
3. Click "🎤 Speak Answer" to provide your answer by voice
4. The system will transcribe your speech and fill the text area
5. Submit your answer as normal

### 2. Enhanced Visual Question Tree Navigation

#### Three View Modes

##### Tree View (Default)
- **Hierarchical expandable tree** showing parent-child relationships
- Visual indicators:
  - ✅ Answered questions

### 3. Cross-Branch Analysis (Already Implemented)

The system performs global analysis when you answer a question:

1. **Local Generation**: Creates detailed follow-up questions on the current branch
2. **Global Updates**: Scans all branches to see if the answer affects other questions
3. **Branch Creation**: Automatically creates new branches for new concepts
4. **Question Injection**: Adds relevant questions to existing branches

### 4. Persistent State Tracking

- ✅ Tracks which questions are answered vs pending
- ✅ Maintains question tree structure across sessions
- ✅ Saves all answers to the Truth knowledge base
- ✅ Progress indicator shows completion percentage

## Installation

### Required Dependencies

```bash
# Core dependencies (already installed)
pip install streamlit pydantic python-dotenv google-genai

# Voice AI dependencies (NEW)
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3

# System dependencies for TTS (Linux/Ubuntu)
sudo apt-get install espeak espeak-ng
```

### Optional Dependencies

```bash
# For better microphone support
pip install pyaudio

# For Google Cloud TTS (higher quality)
pip install google-cloud-texttospeech
```

## Configuration

### Voice Service Options

The voice service automatically detects available features:

- ✅ **Speech Recognition**: Available if `SpeechRecognition` is installed
- ✅ **Text-to-Speech**: Available if `pyttsx3` and `espeak` are installed
- ⚠️ **Google TTS**: Requires Google Cloud credentials (optional)

### Voice Settings

You can customize voice properties in `src/services/voice_service.py`:

```python
# Speech recognition settings
self.recognizer.energy_threshold = 4000  # Microphone sensitivity
self.recognizer.dynamic_energy_threshold = True  # Auto-adjust

# TTS settings
self.tts_engine.setProperty('rate', 150)  # Speech speed (words per minute)
self.tts_engine.setProperty('volume', 0.9)  # Volume (0.0 to 1.0)
```

## Usage Guide

### Starting a New Project with Voice AI

1. **Create Project**: Enter project details and click "Create Project"
2. **Enable Voice**: Check "🎤 Enable Voice AI" on the world-building page
3. **Hear Question**: Click "🔊 Hear Question" to hear the AI ask the initial question
4. **Speak Answer**: Click "🎤 Speak Answer" and speak your story idea
5. **Submit**: Review the transcription and click "Start World Building"

### Navigating the Question Tree

1. **Choose View Mode**: Select Tree View, List by Category, or Timeline
2. **Explore Questions**: 
   - In Tree View: Expand nodes to see follow-up questions
   - In Category View: Browse by character, plot, or setting
   - In Timeline View: See questions in creation order
3. **Jump to Question**: Click "Answer This Question" or "Answer" button
4. **Answer with Voice**: Use "🎤 Speak Answer" for voice input
5. **Submit Answer**: The system generates new follow-up questions

### Best Practices

#### For Voice Input
- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- Use a quiet environment for best results
- Review transcription before submitting
- Fall back to typing if speech recognition fails

#### For Question Navigation
- Use Tree View to understand relationships
- Use Category View to focus on specific aspects
- Use Timeline View to see overall progress
- Jump between branches as needed - don't feel locked in

#### For Story Development
- Answer questions in any order that feels natural
- Skip questions you're not ready to answer
- Return to skipped questions later
- Let the AI generate follow-ups to guide you

## Technical Architecture

### Voice Service (`src/services/voice_service.py`)

```python
class VoiceService:
    def listen_for_speech(timeout, phrase_time_limit) -> str
    def speak_text(text) -> bool
    def is_speech_recognition_available() -> bool
    def is_tts_available() -> bool
    def get_available_features() -> dict
```

### Enhanced UI Components (`app.py`)

- **Voice Controls**: Checkbox to enable/disable voice AI
- **Tree Visualization**: Three view modes with interactive navigation
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Shows question path
- **Jump Navigation**: Click to navigate to any question
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar and statistics

### Question Tree Structure (`src/models/truth.py`)

```python
class QuestionNode:
    id: str
    question: str
    answer: Optional[str]
    status: QuestionStatus  # pending, answered, skipped
    entity_type: EntityType  # character, plot_event, setting
    parent_id: Optional[str]
    children_ids: list[str]

class QuestionTree:
    root_id: str
    nodes: dict[str, QuestionNode]
    
    def get_pending_questions() -> list[QuestionNode]
    def get_answered_questions() -> list[QuestionNode]
    def get_node(node_id) -> QuestionNode
```

## Troubleshooting

### Voice Input Not Working

**Problem**: "Could not understand speech" error

**Solutions**:
1. Check microphone permissions
2. Reduce background noise
3. Speak more clearly
4. Increase timeout: `listen_for_speech(timeout=15)`
5. Fall back to text input

### Voice Output Not Working

**Problem**: No sound when clicking "🔊 Hear Question"

**Solutions**:
1. Check if espeak is installed: `espeak --version`
2. Install espeak: `sudo apt-get install espeak espeak-ng`
3. Check system audio settings
4. Verify TTS initialization: Run `python test_voice.py`

### Tree View Not Showing

**Problem**: Question tree appears empty

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure you've answered the initial question
2. Check that question tree was initialized
3. Verify project was saved: Check `data/projects/` directory
4. Try refreshing the page

## API Reference

### Voice Service Methods

#### `listen_for_speech(timeout=10, phrase_time_limit=None)`
Listen for speech input from microphone.

**Parameters**:
- `timeout` (int): Maximum time to wait for speech to start (seconds)
- `phrase_time_limit` (int, optional): Maximum time for the phrase (seconds)

**Returns**: `str | None` - Transcribed text or None if failed

#### `speak_text(text)`
Convert text to speech and play it.

**Parameters**:
- `text` (str): The text to speak

**Returns**: `bool` - True if successful, False otherwise

#### `get_available_features()`
Get information about available voice features.

**Returns**: `dict[str, bool]` - Feature availability:
```python
{
    'speech_recognition': bool,
    'text_to_speech': bool,
    'google_tts': bool,
    'pyttsx3': bool
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Speech Recognition
- **Latency**: 1-3 seconds for transcription
- **Accuracy**: 85-95% in quiet environments
- **Network**: Requires internet connection (uses Google API)

### Text-to-Speech
- **Latency**: Near-instant with pyttsx3
- **Quality**: Good with espeak, excellent with Google TTS
- **Network**: No internet required for pyttsx3

### UI Rendering
