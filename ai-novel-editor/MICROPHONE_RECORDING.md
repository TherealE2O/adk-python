### Example 2: Character Development

**Recording** (45 seconds):
> "Elena is a 45-year-old veteran of the Earth Defense Force. She's tough, experienced, and haunted by the loss of her family during the Fall of Earth.

### Example 3: Chapter Content

**Recording** (2 minutes):
> "The bridge was silent except for the steady beep of the proximity alarm. Elena stared at the viewscreen, her hands gripping the armrests of the captain's chair. The alien station loomed before them, a massive structure of impossible geometry that seemed to shift and change as she watched. 'Status report,' she said, her voice steady despite the knot of fear in her stomach. 'All systems nominal, Captain,' replied her first officer, Lieutenant Chen. 'But I'm reading some strange energy signatures from the station. Nothing in our database matches.' Elena nodded slowly. This was it. The moment that would change everything."
