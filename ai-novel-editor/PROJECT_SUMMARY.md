## 🎯 Design Decisions

### 1. Modular Architecture
- **Why**: Separation of concerns, testability, maintainability
- **Result**: Clean interfaces between models, services, agents, and UI

### 2. Pydantic Models
- **Why**: Type safety, validation, serialization
- **Result**: Robust data handling with automatic validation

### 3. JSON Storage
- **Why**: Simple, portable, human-readable
- **Result**: Easy debugging and no database setup required

### 4. Streamlit UI
- **Why**: Rapid development, Python-native, interactive
- **Result**: Full-featured UI with minimal code

### 5. Agent-Based Design
- **Why**: Follows ADK patterns, modular AI capabilities
- **Result**: Easy to extend with new AI features

## 🔄 Integration with Google ADK

### Current State
The application is designed to be ADK-compatible:
- Models use Pydantic (ADK standard)
- Agent structure follows ADK patterns
- Context management similar to ADK
- Ready for full ADK integration

### Future ADK Integration
To fully integrate with Google ADK:
1. Replace custom agents with ADK Agent class
2. Use ADK's LLM connection management
3. Implement ADK tools for entity extraction
4. Use ADK's session management
5. Add ADK's memory/RAG capabilities

Example:
```python
from google.adk import Agent

worldbuilding_agent = Agent(
    name="worldbuilding_assistant",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
    instruction="...",
    tools=[extract_character, extract_plot, extract_setting]
)
```

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

### ADK Concepts Applied
1. **Agent Design**: Modular, purpose-specific agents
2. **Context Management**: Maintaining state across interactions
3. **Tool Integration**: Structured function calling
4. **Session Management**: Persistent conversation state
5. **Prompt Engineering**: Context-aware prompt construction

### Best Practices Followed
1. **Type Safety**: Pydantic models throughout
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs and docstrings
4. **Testing**: Unit tests for core functionality
5. **Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
