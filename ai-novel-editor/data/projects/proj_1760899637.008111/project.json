  "description": "For Kael, a runner in the smog-choked Undercity, the Phoenix Ember was the score of a lifetime. He didn't count on its owners: the Ordainer-General's personal Inquisitors. These iron-clad hunters wield the Void itself, their runes canceling all magic. In a desperate chase over the city's grinding generator-core, the non-magical thief finds his only escape is to become a conduit for the very artifact that has doomed him.",
