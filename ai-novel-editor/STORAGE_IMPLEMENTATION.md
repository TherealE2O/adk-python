# StorageService Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete JSON-based storage service for persisting novel projects with comprehensive error handling and support for both user and example projects.

## Implementation Details

### Task 4.1: JSON-based Storage Implementation ✅

**File**: `src/services/storage.py`

**Key Features**:
- **save_project()**: Serializes entire Project objects (including Truth KB and chapters) to JSON
- **load_project()**: Deserializes JSON back to Project objects with full model validation
- **Directory Structure**: `data/projects/{project_id}/project.json`
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling for I/O errors, JSON corruption, and serialization failures

**Error Handling**:
- Custom `StorageError` exception for storage-related failures
- Graceful handling of file I/O errors (OSError, IOError)
- JSON corruption detection with JSONDecodeError
- Detailed logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages

### Task 4.2: Project Listing and Management ✅

**Key Features**:
- **list_projects()**: Scans project directories, excludes examples by default
- **list_example_projects()**: Specifically lists projects from `data/projects/examples/`
- **delete_project()**: Removes entire project directory with error handling
- **project_exists()**: Checks both user and example directories
- **Example Project Support**: Automatic routing based on `is_example` flag

**Directory Structure**:
```
data/
└── projects/
    ├── {project_id}/
    │   └── project.json
    └── examples/
        └── {example_id}/
            └── project.json
```

## Technical Implementation

### Serialization Strategy
- Uses Pydantic's `model_dump(mode='json')` for automatic serialization
- Handles datetime objects with `default=str` parameter
- UTF-8 encoding with `ensure_ascii=False` for international characters
- Pretty-printed JSON with 2-space indentation

### Error Recovery
- Corrupted projects are skipped during listing (logged as warnings)
- Missing directories are created automatically on initialization
- Failed saves raise StorageError with context
- Load operations return None for missing projects

### Logging
- INFO level: Successful operations
- WARNING level: Skipped corrupted files
- ERROR level: Failed operations with details

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_storage.py`:
- ✅ Save and load project with chapters and Truth data
- ✅ Project existence checking
- ✅ Project listing (user and example separation)
- ✅ Project deletion
- ✅ Example project handling
- ✅ Non-existent project handling
- ✅ Corrupted file handling

## Requirements Satisfied

- **Requirement 1.5**: Project persistence and loading ✅
- **Requirement 1.2**: Project listing functionality ✅
- **Requirement 1.3**: Example project support ✅

## Code Quality

- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ No type errors
- ✅ Comprehensive docstrings
- ✅ Type hints throughout
- ✅ Follows Python best practices

## Next Steps

The StorageService is ready for integration with:
- Task 5: ProjectManager service (will use StorageService for persistence)
- Task 11: Project manager UI (will display projects from StorageService)
- Task 17: Example project creation (will use StorageService to save examples)
