# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies requirements for an AI-assisted novel writing application. The system guides users through an interactive world-building process to establish story fundamentals (plot, characters, setting), creating a knowledge base called "The Truth." This Truth grounds all subsequent AI-powered writing assistance, ensuring consistency and continuity throughout the novel writing process.

**Tech Stack Constraints:**
* Primary Language: Python
* AI Agent Framework: Google agent development kits
* Other tools and libraries at implementer's discretion

## Glossary

- **Application**: The AI Novel Writing Editor system
- **User**: The novelist using the Application

- **Project**: A single novel with its associated Truth and chapters
- **Voice AI**: The conversational AI interface that conducts the Q&A process
- **Question Tree**: The branching structure of questions generated during world-building
- **Chapter**: A discrete section of the novel being written
